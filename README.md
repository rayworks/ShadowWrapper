## ShadowWrapper

A wrapper for implementing View's shadow effect.

# [WIP]
Support easily setting View's shadow attributes including shadow’s color and direction.

Inspired from Medium article [Take control of view’s shadow — Android](https://medium.com/@ArmanSo/take-control-of-views-shadow-android-c6b35ba573e9).
